 * and back to the screen (their own DisposableEffect/factory only fires once per composable
 * lifetime, so a load that failed while offline would otherwise just sit failed forever).
 *
 * A single shared observer (started once from MessagesApp.onCreate) instead of every individual
 * ad composable registering its own ConnectivityManager callback -- a list screen can have many
 * simultaneous native ad slots, and each one doing that would be wasteful.
