 * is about to be needed before its screen even composes (e.g. Home's banner, preloaded from
 * Splash so it's likely already loaded by the time Home is visible). Unlike [NativeAdCache], this
 * caches the actual [AdView] (banners are inherently view-bound, unlike NativeAd/InterstitialAd),
 * created off-screen here and handed over â€” still attached to nothing â€” for the real screen to
 * mount into its layout. Falls back to loading on-render as usual (see [BannerAdView]) if nothing
 * is cached â€” this is purely an optional head start, not a requirement.
